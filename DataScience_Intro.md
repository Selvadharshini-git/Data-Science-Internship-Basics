## What is Data Science?
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines elements of statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to analyze data and generate valuable predictions or decisions. The data science process involves data collection, cleaning, exploration, visualization, and modeling using techniques such as machine learning and statistical analysis.

## Difference between Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning 
While often used interchangeably, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) are distinct fields.  
- **Data Science** focuses on extracting insights from data using various techniques, including statistical analysis and machine learning.  
- **AI** is a broader concept that refers to machines simulating human intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.  
- **Machine Learning** is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance without explicit programming.  

In essence, Data Science uses AI and ML as tools to analyze and interpret data, while AI and ML focus on creating intelligent systems.

## Real-World Applications of Data Science  
Data Science has transformed various industries, including:  
1. **Healthcare** – Predictive analytics for disease detection, personalized treatment recommendations, and drug discovery.  
2. **Finance** – Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and customer risk assessment.  
3. **E-commerce** – Personalized recommendations, price optimization, and customer sentiment analysis.  
4. **Marketing** – Customer segmentation, targeted advertising, and campaign effectiveness analysis.  
5. **Manufacturing** – Predictive maintenance to prevent equipment failures and optimize supply chains.  
6. **Social Media** – Content recommendation, fake news detection, and sentiment analysis.
